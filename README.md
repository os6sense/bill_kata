A good user experience would require understanding who the users are and what
their needs are. It has been suggested [1] that there are broadly three types 
of user who should be considered when designing a B2C applicaition namely
'inspectors', 'scanners' and 'ignorers'.  

I mention this specifically because of the requirement for a "good user experience"
specified within this challenge. If one examines the UX requirements in
more than basic detail, the absence of dates and times on calls and purchases
would be likely to frustrate inspectors and increase the likelyhood of scanners
suspecting a mistake; this makes providing a good UX experience challenging 
if one accepts that these are correctly identified as user groups.
